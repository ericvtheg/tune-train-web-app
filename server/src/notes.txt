Things that need to be done:
* how to upload song safely (i.e. making 100% sure song is uploaded)

Nice to haves: (sort these by priority)
* findUnHeardSong -> discoverSong
* profanity filter for description / etc
* how to make sure description etc can't be used to embed javascript code
* song of the day (first song shown when joining website)
* ability to add genres to song and search by them?
* add comments (make only visible after locking in like?)
* listenToSong -> rateSong / critiqueSong / reviewSong / ?
* highlight a portion of the song
* need links to the direct song, not just spotify profile (this is different than socials)
* fail if !exist for s3 download
* make the necessary endpoints not require authentication
* socials 
* extra endpoint verification for 
  * song delete
  * listen to song
* Test does my service/repo transient thing work?
* datetime scalar
* apollo logging plugin
* prisma logging middleware
* https://github.com/slicknode/graphql-query-complexity
* https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/cli-plugin
* connection types for pagination
* get typesafe config service
* how to better error handle in nestjs?
* validate mutation inputs / queries
* prisma data loader
* add integration/e2e tests
* figure out how to best mock providers/entities
* better unit tests, service layer should only test for branching, entity repositories should have unit tests

// ***** cloud infra stuff
// destroy
// make it so literally everything is built using just terraform CLI
// cloudfront caching and rate limiting
// add billing alerts through terraform
// create new AWS account (add + in the email address)
// only thing that should have to be manually done is transferring domain & the terraform state bucket
// remember there was some weirdness with configuring ssl certificate and associating it with a domain/hosted zone
// will need to run prisma generate or whatever on deployment

UI Needs (TODO sort by priority ):
* Logo
* Discovery Tool
  * artist avatar
  * user avatar (?)
  * stage name
  * song title
  * song description
  * mp3 player (would like this to be pretty)
  * like / dislike
  * would like to look at artist page without leaving song
  * socials (TBD)
* Some sort of home bar that shows stageName/firstName w/ avatar
* Discovered Songs for user page would be cool (kind of requires a connection graphql type)
* Some sort of metrics page for artist would be cool
* Account Page (iffy on how this one should work - overall I don't think people should need to leave the listening experience)
  * ability to update account (user/artist) info if viewing user owns it
  * ability to become artist
* Upload song Modal
* Sign up Modal (overall I would like artists to get a general feel for the website before uploading songs)
  * User sign up > (should automatically log user in)
  * Artist Sign up modal (optional)
* Song upload modal
  * Song name
  * description
  * file upload
* General explanation of tune train's mission

Call to actions:
